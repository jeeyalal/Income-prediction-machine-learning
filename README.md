# Income Prediction Machine Learning

This repository contains the implementation of an Income Prediction Machine Learning model. The project aims to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually based on demographic and work-related attributes. The dataset used for this project is the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Adult Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes demographic and work-related attributes for individuals. The target variable is whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually.

Attributes include:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Marital-status
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Sex
- Capital-gain
- Capital-loss
- Hours-per-week
- Native-country

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt.

## Usage

The project is organized into Jupyter notebooks for ease of understanding and experimentation. The main steps are:
1. Data Exploration: Understand the dataset and visualize the distributions of various features.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
3. Model Training: Train various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Results

The performance of each model has been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are documented in the model evaluation notebook.

## Technologies Used
